% Here we set the total count of the pages in the book and set the size
% of the page to 6x9 inches. You can set your own size like this:
%   \setlength\kdpxsize{8.1in}
%   \setlength\kdpysize{12.7in}
% It's better not to use "pages" option here, but to let it calculate
% the size of your book from the PDF file. Just say "pdf=book.pdf" and it
% will be calculated automatically.
%
% To get rid of the black bar at the center of the page, just add
% "barless" option here.
\documentclass[pages=200,6x9]{kdpcover}

\begin{document}
% Here we put the vertical black spine line with two white elements
% inside: the text at the top and the logo at the bottom. Make sure
% the text is short enough so that it doesn't touch the logo. It's
% a good practice to mention the volume number at the end of the text,
% if you have more than one volume, e.g. "my book, vol. 1". I suggest
% using small caps in the text only.
\putSpine{kdpcover, a LaTeX class for KDP books}

% This one prints the volume picture. It is intentionally made large,
% in order to make it obvious.
\putVolume{1}

% Here we print the version and it will also add the date of the latest
% Git commit in the current directory. If it's not a Git repository,
% the date won't be printed.
\putVersion{0.0.0}

% This prints the price, which is a good practice to mention, I believe.
\putPrice{\$0.00}

% This one prints the copyright short message with the year and the
% name of the autor.
\putCopyright{\the\year}{Yegor Bugayenko}

% Here we print the title of the book
\putTitle{kdpcover}

% Here we print the author.
\putAuthor{Yegor Bugayenko}

% Here we print the TL;DR paragraph, which summarizies the message
% of the entire book.
\putTLDR{I use this LaTeX class to design covers for my books published
by Kindle Direct Publishing; you also can do it, provided you like the layout and the style.}

% The picture.
\putPicture{cactus.pdf}

% This is the text on the back of the book, which usually I suggest
% to omit and keep the back empty and white.
\putBack{
    You need to either specify the number of pages
    in your PDF book, or provide the path to the PDF.
    In the latter case, the pages will be counted using
    "qpdf," which has to be installed:
    \newline\newline
    \char`\\documentclass[pages=200,pdf=book.pdf]\string{kdpcover\string}\newline
    \char`\\begin\string{document\string}\newline
    \char`\\putSpine\string{my book\string}\newline
    \char`\\end\string{document\string}
    \newline\newline
    See the file "kdpcover.tex" for a full example with all
    available commands and class options.
    \newline\newline
